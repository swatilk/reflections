When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories are extremely useful when we want share our code/changes with others. This will let others contribute to the code if they wish to. Also, keeping the code on remote repository also lets us modify it or copy it onto another server and work on it later on.
